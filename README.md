# Installation

```bash
composer require mustafakhaleddev/nova-rtl-support
```

##### Select supported locales for RTL
by default we will use `ar` locale as default locale for the package.
but if you want to use other locales you can just add this line to your `config/app.php` file
```javascript
    'novaRTL'=> ['ar'],
```
